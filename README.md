# PortfolioOptimizer

# Instructions

1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Please download Anaconda Navigator as you will need it to setup the python environment
3. Open this project as a Django project in PyCharm IDE
4. In Anaconda Navigator CMD Prompt run "conda config --show channels". If "conda-forge" is not displayed then run "conda config --add channels conda-forge"
5. Use the env.yaml file to setup a conda environment in Anaconda Navigator Environments tab by clicking on "Import" and loading the env.yaml file.
5.Once your python environment is completely setup,  enter "python manage.py migrate" and then "python manage.py
   runserver". This should launch the Django WebApp.
6. For viewing the main logic I have also included the jupyter notebooks in this repository which you may run as well.
