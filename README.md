# Instructions

1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Open this project as a Django project in PyCharm IDE
3. Use the env.yaml file to setup a conda environemnt in Anaconda Navigator.
4. Use the requirements.txt file to fulfill any remaining libraries/dependencies in case the conda env setup is not
   fully successful.
5. Once your python environemnt is completely setup, enter "python manage.py runserver". This should launch the Django
   WebApp.
6. For viewing the main logic I have also included the jupyter notebooks in this repository which you may run as well.
